# Skin Cancer Metadata Analysis

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive metadata analysis project focused on skin cancer data. The project is part of the academic curriculum at **Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná (UTFPR)** and serves as a practical application of data science methodologies.

## 🎓 Academic Context

- **Course:** OPT004 - Ciência de Dados (Data Science)
- **Institution:** Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná (UTFPR)
- **Purpose:** Hypothesis testing and statistical analysis of skin cancer metadata

## 🎯 Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Hypothesis Testing:** Apply statistical methods to test various hypotheses related to skin cancer metadata
2. **Data Exploration:** Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations
3. **Statistical Analysis:** Utilize appropriate statistical techniques to derive meaningful insights
4. **Data Visualization:** Create informative visualizations to communicate findings effectively

## 📊 Dataset

This project utilizes a skin cancer metadata dataset that includes various attributes related to skin cancer cases. The analysis focuses on extracting meaningful patterns and testing scientific hypotheses through rigorous data science methodologies.

### Key Areas of Analysis

- Patient demographics and characteristics
- Cancer type classifications and distributions
- Temporal patterns and trends
- Risk factors and correlations
- Statistical significance testing

## 🔬 Methodology

The analysis follows a structured data science workflow:

1. **Data Collection:** Gathering and organizing skin cancer metadata
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing data for analysis
3. **Exploratory Analysis:** Understanding data distributions and relationships
4. **Hypothesis Formulation:** Developing testable hypotheses based on domain knowledge
5. **Statistical Testing:** Applying appropriate statistical tests to validate hypotheses
6. **Results Interpretation:** Drawing conclusions from the analysis

## 🛠️ Technologies

The project leverages common data science tools and libraries, including:

- Python for data analysis and processing
- Statistical libraries for hypothesis testing
- Visualization tools for data presentation
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis
